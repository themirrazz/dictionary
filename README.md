## ~~FAQ~~ QPWPAITF (Questions People Will Probably Ask In The Future)
### How big is this dictionary?
Pretty small right now, but it's growing slowly.

### Does this dictionary contain slurs?
Kind of. This dictionary does *not* include strong slurs or racist terms; however, it does contain a few words that may act as slurs in certain contexts but not others. We mark these definitions of words with `"slur": true` to help make filtering unwanted content easier, and don't include examples for these terms. Please note that this is a dictionary - its goal is to provide a database of knowledge. Just becase a word is in here does NOT mean I support or condone using this word.

### Does this dictionary contain modern slang?
Yes, this dictionary includes modern slang, commonly known as "Gen Alpha slang." Words like skibidi, rizzler, and gyatt are all listed with definitions. Hopefully this will also help older people understand the younger generation. Plus, there's often confusion as to what these words actually mean. While the general consensus is they have no meaning, there is almost always a meaning. So I thought by including these slang words, the meaning would become more clear.

### Does this dictionary contain swear words?
Yes, this dictionary contains mild, moderate, and strong swear words. Strong and moderate swear words (e.g. sh*t) are marked with `"vulgar": true`. Mild swear words aren't marked and don't have any flags.

### Does this dictionary contain terms used in specific groups?
Yes - my dictionary has Canadian, British, and Australian variants of words, as well as modern slang and words that might be used in different communities. One example of this is the word "ass", which refers to a screenshot of an error dialog in the crazy error community. (The word originates from the word "asset.") It also includes words used in other communities, such as the weeb, furry, and gaming communities, though this is not a definite list. This does *not* mean it include words from all communities, nor does it include all words from a community. When a foreign word becomes popular, I might end up also adding it to my dictionary - you can find this with the `"foreign": true` flag.

### What formats is this dictionary available in?
Currently, I'm working on it in JSON, though I want to support an XML version (and maybe even a YAML version) in the future.

### How do I contribute to the dictionary?
I currently don't accept entries to this dictionary.
